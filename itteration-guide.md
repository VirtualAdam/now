# NOW (Notes On Work)

**Prevent AI-generated code projects from becoming archaeological sites.**

## The Problem

You're working on a project. AI helps you generate code fast. You switch to another project. A week/month/year later, you come back and have no idea:

- What problem you were solving
- What was blocking you
- What you were about to try next
- Whether the tests actually pass or AI just claimed they did

Multiply this across dozens of AI-accelerated projects and you end up abandoning perfectly good code because the context is lost.

## The Solution

**One minimal file (`NOW.md`) at the root of every repo that:**

- Takes 30 seconds to generate/update via `/now` command
- Takes <5 minutes to read and fully reorient
- Prevents false "task completed" claims via evidence requirements
- Designed for GitHub Copilot to read first, humans second

## Quick Start

### 1. Install NOW in Your Project

```bash
# Clone or download this repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/now.git

# Copy the .prompt folder to your project
cp -r now/.prompt /path/to/your/project/

# That's it. The .prompt folder now lives in your project.
```

### 2. Create Your First NOW

In your project (with GitHub Copilot enabled):

```
You: /now
```

Copilot will analyze your codebase and conversation history and generate `NOW.md` at your repo root.

### 3. Update Before You Leave

At the end of your work session:

```
You: /now
```

Copilot updates the NOW with current state, blockers, and next steps.

### 4. Resume Work Later

When you return (tomorrow or next year):

1. Open `NOW.md`
2. Read it (takes 2-3 minutes)
3. You now know exactly where you left off and what to do next

## What's in the NOW?

A minimal 5-section structure (<500 words):

```yaml
META          # Version, last updated
STATE         # What problem, current focus, what's blocking
EVIDENCE      # Test status with proof (no false claims)
NEXT          # Single immediate task with completion criteria
CONTEXT       # Key decisions & failed approaches (optional)
```

See [NOW.md](NOW.md) for the complete schema specification.

## Testing Your NOW

Verify your NOW is working correctly:

```bash
# Run all tests
python .prompt/now-test.py all

# Test specific aspects
python .prompt/now-test.py generate   # Generation performance
python .prompt/now-test.py evidence   # Evidence integrity
python .prompt/now-test.py queries    # Query coverage
python .prompt/now-test.py reorient   # Reorientation time (manual)
python .prompt/now-test.py trends     # Show improvement over time
```

**Target Metrics:**

- Generation time: <30 seconds
- File size: <2000 tokens
- Evidence accuracy: >90%
- Query coverage: >85%
- Reorientation time: <5 minutes

## Iterating & Improving

The NOW format is designed to evolve based on real usage data. See [.prompt/iteration-guide.md](.prompt/iteration-guide.md) for:

- Scientific testing methodology
- Objective metrics framework
- A/B testing protocols
- Iteration log template

## Real-World Example

**Before NOW:**

```
You: "Uh... I think I was working on authentication? 
      Or was it the search feature? 
      Let me dig through these 47 AI-generated design docs..."
```

**After NOW:**

```
You: *Opens NOW.md*

STATE:
  problem_solving: "Build authentication system for multi-tenant SaaS"
  current_focus: "Implementing JWT refresh token rotation"
  blocked_by: "Redis connection failing in test environment"

NEXT:
  immediate_task:
    intent: "Fix Redis connection string in test config"
    done_when: "Integration tests pass with Redis interaction"
    evidence_required: ["reports/integration_tests_passing.json"]

You: "Oh right. Redis config. Got it."
*Starts coding immediately*
```

## Design Principles

1. **Ruthlessly minimal** - If it's not essential for reorientation, it's cut
2. **Evidence-based** - Claims require proof (files must exist)
4. **Machine-first** - Optimized for AI parsing, human-readable second
5. **Single source of truth** - Only one NOW per repo (canonical: true enforced)
6. **Force focus** - One immediate task at a time prevents diffusion
6. **No archaeology** - Small enough to read in one sitting

## Why Not Just Use README.md?

READMEs are for:

- What the project does (for users/contributors)
- How to install/use it
- General architecture

NOW is for:

- Where development stopped
- What specific problem blocked you
- What concrete task to do next
- Proof that tests actually pass

They serve different purposes. Keep both.

## Why Not Use Issues/Project Boards?

Issues are great for backlog/planning. But when you have 30 AI-accelerated projects:

- Opening GitHub and finding the right issue takes too long
- Issue comments sprawl into archaeology
- No single source of "current true state"
- No evidence gating for completion claims

NOW is the instant reorientation layer. Issues are for broader planning.

## Contributing

Found a way to make NOW better? We use a scientific iteration process:

1. Form a hypothesis (e.g., "Adding X field will improve Y metric by Z%")
2. Make the change to `.prompt/now.md`
3. Run the test harness on ≥5 projects
4. Document results in iteration log
5. Submit PR with before/after metrics

See [.prompt/iteration-guide.md](.prompt/iteration-guide.md) for details.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this work with other AI coding assistants besides GitHub Copilot?**
A: The `.prompt` folder pattern is becoming standard across AI coding tools. The NOW format itself is tool-agnostic YAML that any AI can parse.

**Q: What if my project is huge with multiple components?**
A: Force focus on what you're *currently* working on. Link to architecture docs for the big picture. The NOW captures your immediate development context, not comprehensive documentation.

**Q: Won't this get stale quickly?**
A: That's the point of `/now` at the end of each session. The test harness tracks staleness. If NOW.md is >30 days old, it flags for update.

**Q: What about team projects where multiple people work simultaneously?**
A: Each person can update the NOW when they finish. Git merge conflicts force conversation about true state. Alternatively, each person can maintain a personal NOW branch.

**Q: Can I customize the NOW structure for my needs?**
A: Yes, but use the iteration framework to prove your changes improve objective metrics. Don't add sections "just in case."

**TL;DR:** Copy `.prompt/` folder to your project. Type `/now` before you stop working. Never lose context again.
